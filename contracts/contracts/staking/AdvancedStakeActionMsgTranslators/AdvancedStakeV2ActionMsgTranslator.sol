/**
 * @title AdvancedStakeV2ActionMsgTranslator
 * @notice It processes action messages for stakes of the `advanced-v2` type.
 * @dev It "translates" the `action` in messages so that other contracts, which
 * are "unaware" of "v2" stake type, may process this type stakes exactly like
 * they process `advanced` type stakes.
 * It shall be registered with the `RewardMaster` as the "RewardAdviser" for
 * `advanced-v2` type stakes and the "ActionOracle" for `advanced` type stakes.
 * Being called `getRewardAdvice` by the RewardMaster for a message with the
 * `advanced-v2` STAKE action, it replaces the `action` to be the `advanced`
 * (but not `advanced-v2`) STAKE action.
 * Then it calls `onAction` on the RewardMaster with the substituted message.
 * When called back, the latter processes the substituted action message as if
 * it is the `advanced` (not `advanced-v2`) STAKE action.
